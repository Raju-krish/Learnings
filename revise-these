1. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
We'll cover:

	Pipes (anonymous and named)

	Message Queues

	Shared Memory (with semaphores for sync)

	Sockets (UNIX domain and TCP/IP)

	Signals

2. Data Structures in C
	Weâ€™ll implement and analyze:

	Linked lists (single, double, circular)

	Stacks and queues (array and linked list based)

	Trees (binary, BST, AVL)

	Hash tables (with collision handling)

	Graphs (adjacency matrix/list)

3. Function Pointers
We'll cover:

	Basics and syntax

	Callbacks

	Arrays of function pointers

	Function pointer use in real-world systems (e.g., state machines, drivers, event dispatchers)

4. Other Core C Concepts
Including:

	Memory management (malloc/free, leaks, fragmentation)

	Structs with pointers

	Bit manipulation
	
	File I/O (and mmap)

	System calls and how they relate to user/kernel space
